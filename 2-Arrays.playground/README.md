## What are Arrays
 - The humble Array.
    - What goes on behind the scene.
    - What happens if an array exceeds its capacity and gets too big

    Most commonly used Data Structures
   Collection of elements all of the same type that can be set and retrieved by their indices
    
 

 get(i) set(i, value) insert(i, value) delete(i)

### Three things about arrays 
- Arrays can contain anything
    ```
    let ints = [Int]()
    let strings = [String]()
    let people =[Person]()
    ```
- Arryas are of a fixed size
- Arrays support random access
