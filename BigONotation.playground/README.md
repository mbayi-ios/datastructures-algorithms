### What is BigO Notation
- Language computer scientists use when comparing the performance of algorithms
  *It's all about dominant operations*
  - Time(How fast)
  - Space(how much memory)
 
- We talk of BigO Notation interms of WorstCase Performance

### Most common Characteristics are:
1. Constant O(1)
2. Linear O(n)
3. Quadratic O(n^2)
4. Logarithmic O(logN)

- When talking about BigO we always need to talk about the worst case performance - we just dont look at the best case how algorithm runs, we always check on the worst case and thats the bigONotation of how that algorithm works
- We can often trade off time for space. We can improve the performance of an algorithm by taking more space eg by creating a hash map but we gain a lot interms of time by doing that

NOTE: Hash Mpas/ Dictionaries are your bestfriend to improve the performance of algorithm
